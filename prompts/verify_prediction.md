You are given a cropped screenshot. Your task is to evaluate whether the marked element in the red box matches the target described in my instruction.
Please follow these steps:
1. Analyze the screenshot by describing its visible content and functionalities.
2. Determine which of the following applies:
- 'is_target': The marked element is the target.
- 'target_elsewhere': The marked element is not the target, but it exists elsewhere.
- 'target_not_found': The marked element is not the target, and it does not exist.
3. If the target exists, rewrite the instruction to make it clearer.

After your analysis, provide the result in JSON format matching the schema.

Here is my instruction:
{config.instruction}
